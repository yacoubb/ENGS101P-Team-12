                                </header>
                                <p>Programming Principles, Logic and Verification is an area of research dedicated to the production of mathematical concepts and theorems which are used to help in other areas of computer science. These concepts are used in a wide range of fields, from information security to program verification. The group’s work includes both highly theoretical and practical fields, such as logic, semantics and theorem proving as well as system modelling, artificial intelligence and language design. The work that the PPLV group do will in turn benefit areas of computer science that the group and others in the discipline can use.</p>

                                </header>
                                <p>The PPLV group have been involved in numerous discoveries and research projects that have been significant contributions to numerous fields in computer science. One such contribution was the recent refinement of automated verification using cyclic proofs, and the development of separation logic. These advances help programs which potentially have millions of lines of code be automatically debugged and verified without requiring a programmer to hard code in the necessary methods of testing. These findings are currently being used by large companies such as Facebook to test their own software.</p>
                                <p>Another example of a significant discovery is the analysis of security policies done to ensure more users can easily comply with things like ever more complex passwords being required. Most of the time in workplaces, employees will likely dismiss any talks had on ‘information security’ since they don’t fully understand the importance of it. The research was done with two major companies to analyse data and construct a security system that meets all the company's security requirements. The project resulted in GCHQ’s revision of their password guidance systems, as well as a complete rewrite of the company's security framework which led to actual change in employee behaviours.</p>

                                <p>To develop automatic program verification methods that help security engineers to understand software that they have not written themselves.</p>

                                <h3>Research and Findings</h3>
                                <p>The main research carried out is focused in one area, Confinement with Origin Web Labels, with several other smaller research being carried out.</p>
                                <h4><b>1. Design and construction of COWL (Confinement with Origin Web Labels)</b></h4><p>
                                    The vast majority of JavaScript code libraries being available online nowadays make it sometimes difficult to distinguish code created for malicious purposes. Many web developers may thus use such code in their applications, leading to the distribution of it further, without having any malicious purposes on the first place though. Of course, in thus way the privacy of any user of the application is at risk, as such malicious code may be used to collect personal data, which are sensitive by nature.<br>
                                    The relevant UCL research team in cooperation with Mozilla, Google, Stanford, and UCSD have developed “Confinement with Origin Web Labels” (COWL), which is a technique used in many internet browser that blocks malicious applications from being able to collect and transmit sensitive data to a third party.
                                </p>
                                <b>Impact</b><br>
                                <ul>

                                    <li>COWL is about to become a standard with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). W3C is in charge of standardising how the internet operates to a great extent and therefore many of the features it standardises are included in servers, web browsers, websites.</li>
                                    <li>Once the standardising of COWL is completed, it is going be embedded by default in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, two of the most widely used internet browsers.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4><b>2. Design and construction of the G8 system</b></h4><p>
                                Developers are humans and it is almost unavoidable to make errors. Such errors may create minor but serious vulnerabilities in server-side applications that may lead to the disclosure of sensitive data, due to wrong access control checks for instance. Server-side applications operate in a server computer instead of operating locally on the clients’ one.<br>
                                This is why G8 has been developed. G8 is a policy system that operates during the run-time of the Node.js JavaScript framework for server-side programs and ensures that:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>No unsafe operations take place</li>
                                    <li>Sensitive information is not disclosed to unauthorised people because of program bugs</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><b>Impact</b><br>A complete version of G8 has been created and it has been proved to successfully prevent exploits of vulnerabilities in some widely-used server-run programs using Node.js.</p>

                                <h3>Partial order semantics for concurrent program verification</h3>
                                <h4>Aim of research</h4>
                                <p>The main purpose of this research area is to solve the concurrent programming errors by achieving the automatic verification with high scalability and then find the automated techniques that can debug the code without executing it.</p>
                                <h4>Problem to be Solved</h4>
                                <p>Multiprocessor systems are computers with more than one central processor. Today, more than ever, there is a growing trend of using multiprocessor system. Those have been widely used on both desktop and portable personal computers, servers and mobile phones and are widely believed to be a cause of concurrent programming errors.</p>
                                <h4>An Example of the Project</h4>
                                <p>PostgreSQL, one of the most popular databases, is relied on by many websites. Unfortunately, a concurrency bug was recently found in it. The bug was particularly hard to observe because it only occurred on a not-so-widely-used multicore machine —IBM Power.</p>
                                <h4>Ideal Solution</h4>
                                <p>The best way to solve such issues is to find automated techniques that can debug the code without having to execute it.</p>
                                <h4>Impact of Research</h4>
                                <p>Concurrent software verification is of major importance to prevent devices that perform crucial operations, such as those on airplanes or healthcare systems, from crashing. Nowadays, these kinds of devices now include many processor cores and thus use concurrent software for operating. Great importance and high practicality are two main parts of the impact, particularly shown in two prospects:</p>

                                    <li>Professional programmers of concurrent software</li>
                                    <li>Multiprocessor designers</li>
                                </ol>
                                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt=""/></span>
                                <h4>Identifiers or the Field's Importance</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>IBM Austin: Derek Williams, a lead engineer in collaboration with the research group in Austin indicates that the project will have a very large potential impact if successful.</li>
                                    <li>Microsoft : MSR — Microsoft Research labs in Cambridge, Redmond and Bangalore, are possibly influenced by the project. Regular meeting will be set between the research group and the MSR researchers. Also, internship opportunities are possible because of the project.</li>
                                    <li>Monoidics, a London based SME is very interested in general verification and effective solution to the concurrency programming errors.</li>
                                    <li>The UK Government views cybersecurity important. The interaction of ours to the public sector will be pushed forward because of the presence of the CyberSecurity institute as UCL, recognised by EPSRC and GCHQ at UCL.</li>
                                    <li>We believe there is a strong connection between our project and the EPRSC thematic area of “Global Uncertainties”</li>

                                </ul>
