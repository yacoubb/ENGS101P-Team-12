        <!--<p>The PPLV group have been involved in numerous discoveries and research projects that have been significant contributions to numerous fields in computer science. One such contribution was the recent refinement of automated verification using
              cyclic proofs, and the development of separation logic. These advances help programs which potentially have millions of lines of code be automatically debugged and verified without requiring a programmer to hard code in the necessary methods
              of testing. These findings are currently being used by large companies such as Facebook to test their own software.</p>
            <p>Another example of a significant discovery is the analysis of security policies done to ensure more users can easily comply with things like ever more complex passwords being required. Most of the time in workplaces, employees will likely
              dismiss any talks had on ‘information security’ since they don’t fully understand the importance of it. The research was done with two major companies to analyse data and construct a security system that meets all the company's security
              requirements. The project resulted in GCHQ’s revision of their password guidance systems, as well as a complete rewrite of the company's security framework which led to actual change in employee behaviours.</p>-->

          <h2>Partial order semantics for concurrent program verification</h2>
          <h4>Aim of research</h4>
          <p>The main purpose of this research area is to solve the concurrent programming errors by achieving the automatic verification with high scalability and then find the automated techniques that can debug the code without executing it.</p>
          <h4>Problem to be Solved</h4>
          <p>Multiprocessor systems are computers with more than one central processor. Today, more than ever, there is a growing trend of using multiprocessor systems. Although used in most modern devices, they are a cause of concurrent programming errors.</p>
          <h4>An Example of the Project</h4>
          <center><span class="image small"><img src="images/postgresql.png" alt=""/></span></center>
          <blockquote>PostgreSQL, one of the most popular databases, is relied on by many websites. Unfortunately, a concurrency bug was recently found in it. The bug was particularly hard to observe because it only occurred on a not-so-widely-used multicore machine
            —IBM Power.
            <nobr><a href="Citations.html"><sup>[7]</sup></a></nobr>
          </blockquote>
          <h4>Ideal Solution</h4>
          <center><span class="image small"><img src="images/ideal_solution.png" alt=""/></span></center>
          <p>The best way to solve issues like this is to find automated techniques that can debug the code without having to execute it.</p>
          <h4>Impact of Research</h4>
          <p>It's imperitive that in systems used in stuff like airplanes and life support machines, crashes don't occur. Since these systems are so complex nowadays and require multi-core processors, they use concurrent software to operate. It follows that
            the algorithms used are completely foolproof at a theoretical level.</p>
          <h4>Identifiers or the Field's Importance</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>IBM Austin: Derek Williams, a lead engineer in collaboration with the IBM research group in Texas indicates that the project will have a very large potential impact if successful.</li>
            <li>Microsoft : MSR — Microsoft Research labs in Cambridge, Redmond heavily influence the project.</li>
            <li>Monoidics, a London based SME is very interested in general verification and effective solution to the concurrency programming errors.</li>

          <h2>Program Verification Techniques for Understanding Security Properties of Software</h2>
          <blockquote> "Program verification is when formal, mathematical techniques are used to debug software and software specifications." - Robert S. Boyer </blockquote>
          <h4>Aim of research</h4>
          <p>To develop automatic program verification methods that help security engineers to understand software that they have not written themselves.</p>
          <h4><u>1. Design and construction of COWL (Confinement with Origin Web Labels)</u><nobr><a href="Citations.html"><sup>[1]</sup></a></nobr></h4>
          <p> The vast majority of JavaScript code libraries being available online nowadays make it sometimes difficult to distinguish code created for malicious purposes. Many web developers may thus use such code in their applications, leading to the distribution
            of it further, without having any malicious purposes on the first place though. Of course, in thus way the privacy of any user of the application is at risk, as such malicious code may be used to collect personal data, which are sensitive
            by nature.<br> The relevant UCL research team in cooperation with Mozilla, Google, Stanford, and UCSD have developed “Confinement with Origin Web Labels” (COWL), which is a technique used in many internet browser that blocks malicious applications
            from being able to collect and transmit sensitive data to a third party. </p>
          <h5>Impact <br><br></h5>
          <ul>
            <li>COWL is about to become a standard with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). W3C is in charge of standardising how the internet operates to a great extent and therefore many of the features it standardises are included in servers, web browsers,
              websites. </li>
              <center><span class="image small"><img src="images/w3c.png" alt=""/></span></center>
            <li>Once the standardising of COWL is completed, it is going be embedded by default in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, two of the most widely used internet browsers.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4><u>2. Design and construction of the G8 system</u></h4>
          <p> Developers are humans and it is almost unavoidable to make errors. Such errors may create minor but serious vulnerabilities in server-side applications that may lead to the disclosure of sensitive data, due to wrong access control checks for
            instance. Server-side applications operate in a server computer instead of operating locally on the clients’ one.</p>
            <p>That is why G8 has been developed. G8 is a policy system that operates during the run-time of the Node.js JavaScript framework
            for server-side programs and ensures that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>No unsafe operations take place</li>
            <li>Sensitive information is not disclosed to unauthorised people because of program bugs</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Impact</h5>
          <p>A complete version of G8 has been created and it has been proved to successfully prevent exploits of vulnerabilities in some widely-used server-run programs using Node.js.</p>
